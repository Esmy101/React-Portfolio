        Full stack web developer leveraging customer service and system testing
        backgrounds to make a more intuitive user experience on the web. Working
        to earn a certificate in full stack development from Michigan State
        University, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, My
        SQL, Node.js, and Bootstrap. Known to be a critical thinker when it
        comes to app design and functionality. With each project, I aim to try
        new things and further develop existing or develop new skills. I worked
        on a team of 5 to develop a MVC app that helps users break or make new
        habits. I pushed myself to further develop my skills by building and
        expanding on a game for the app. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as
        part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on
        the web.
